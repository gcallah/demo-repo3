# demo-repo3

An example flask rest API server, for SE Fall 2022.

To build production, type `make prod`.

Automatic deploy to PythonAnywhere is done by GitHub Actions.

To create the env for a new developer, run `make dev_env`.

We will write a API-driven adventure game where characters explore a world,
meet threats, find treasure, etc.

Each of the main requirements will correspond to an API endpoint.

We will need to carefully consider a security system, and modify the design of
these endpoints to reflect our security policy.
